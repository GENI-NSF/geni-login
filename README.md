# geni-login
The GENI identity provider login page

This code is intended to overlay a
[Shibboleth 2 IdP](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/Home)
source tree for installation. It does not stand alone.

This guide does not cover Shibboleth installation and configuration. This
guide assumes that you already have a working installation and want to
update the login page.

The login page is known to be compatible with Shibboleth IdP 2.3.6 and is
likely compatible with more recent versions of the Shibboleth 2 IdP series.
_This code is not compatible with version 3 of the Shibboleth IdP._

To deploy this code you need to download the Shibboleth 2 IdP source tree:

```
wget http://shibboleth.net/downloads/identity-provider/2.3.6/shibboleth-identityprovider-2.3.6-bin.zip

unzip shibboleth-identityprovider-2.3.6-bin.zip
```

Copy the code in the webapp directory of this repository into the
shbboleth directory:

```
cp -r webapp shibboleth-identityprovider-2.3.6/src/main/webapp
```

Install the identity provider:

```
shibboleth-identityprovider-2.3.6/install.sh
```
